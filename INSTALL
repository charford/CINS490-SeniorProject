JobMe Installation


Requirements Before Installation

* Linux based server, I tested with Ubuntu Server 32bit, should work fine with 64bit

* Internet access

Steps To Install
1. Install Apache webserver
2. Install RVM, Ruby, and Rails
3. Install libmodpassenger
4. Configure rails app
5. Setup the Admin user

=====================================================================================
1. Install Apache webserver
=====================================================================================

  sudo apt-get install apache2

=====================================================================================
2. Install RVM, Ruby, and Rails
=====================================================================================
 
  Install curl:

    sudo apt-get install curl
 
  Install RVM:

    curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

  Load RVM:

    source ~/.rvm/scripts/'rvm'

  Find the requirements(follow the instructions to install them as well):

    rvm requirements

    For Ubuntu Server 11.10 32bit, the requirements can be installed with this line:

      sudo apt-get install build-essential openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf libc6-dev ncurses-dev automake libtool bison subversion nodejs

  Install ruby:

    rvm install 1.9.2

=====================================================================================
3. Install libmodpassenger
=====================================================================================

  Install the passenger gem:

    gem install passenger

  Install the apache2 module:

    passenger-install-apache2-module

    The requirements will be displayed, with instructions on how to install.

    For Ubuntu Server 11.10 32bit, the requirements can be installed with this line:
    
      sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev apache2-prefork-dev libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev

    Once requirements have been installed, try to install module again:
    
      passenger-install-apache2-module

    At the end of the installation, there is 3 lines of code displayed, these
    need to be added to the top of the httpd.conf file.

    For Ubuntu Server 11.10 32bit, the code to add looked like this,
    DO NOT USE, JUST AN EXAMPLE:

      LoadModule passenger_module /home/casey/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194/gems/passenger-3.0.12/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
      PassengerRoot /home/casey/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194/gems/passenger-3.0.12
      PassengerRuby /home/casey/.rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.3-p194/ruby

    On Ubuntu Server 11.10 32bit, the httpd file can be found in:

      /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

=====================================================================================
4. Configure rails app
=====================================================================================

  The instructions below assume you are in the root directory of the rails app. In
  this example, I put the jobme_app in my home directory.

  Configure SMTP server:
  
    vi config/environment.rb
    
    Make sure that the :address is set correctly for your SMTP server. Also check to
    
    make sure the correct port is being used, and domain.

  Install the bundle:

    bundle install

  Migrate db:

    RAILS_ENV='production' rake db:migrate  

  Precompile assets(required to make stylesheets work):

    rake assets:precompile

  Add virtualhost info to apache:

    sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/jobme
    
    For this example, I entered the following into the new file:

     <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName jobme.com
        # !!! Be sure to point DocumentRoot to 'public'!
        DocumentRoot /home/casey/jobme_app/public
        <Directory /home/casey/jobme_app/public>
           # This relaxes Apache security settings.
           AllowOverride all
           # MultiViews must be turned off.
           Options -MultiViews
        </Directory>
     </VirtualHost>

  Restart apache:
    
    sudo apachectl restart

 
  You may need to restart the rails app:

    From within the jobme root directory, do the following:
    
    mkdir tmp
    touch tmp/restart.txt
  
=====================================================================================
5. Setup the Admin user
=====================================================================================

  The first user to be created in the system is automatically assigned as the admin.

  Use the web interface to "sign up" as a new user. The user must be activated, to

  do this, retrieve the email that is sent with a confirmation link. 

  
  If you don't have access to the email, you will need the confirmation hash, which

  can be retireved using the rails console.

  
    RAILS_ENV='production' rails c

    Confirmation.all

    Using the hash, you would make a url similar to the following:

    http://jobme/users/1/confirm/faa3606f13279b82d3a50861e2dc1fca7de149e99769d47d4e98411507b78cb2

    If you navigate to the URL, you will be able to activate the user.

  
    If the above method does not work, you can add a row to the ActiveUsers table, which will

    Activate the user. It is recommended that you remove the confirmation hash when finished.

    From the rails console:

      au = Activeuser.new
      au.user_id = 1
      au.save

      Confirmation.find_by_user_id(1).destroy
